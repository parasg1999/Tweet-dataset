789359407855341600,Fri Oct 21 06:55:23 +0000 2016,FOCUS UPDATE - Anything that's close - the XL focuses on it quicker but anything longer than macro distance the s7 is MUCH quicker to focus
789353120534896600,Fri Oct 21 06:30:24 +0000 2016,The S7 vs Pixel camera comparison seems to be going a similar route - Pixel works better in good light, the s7 does better in low light
