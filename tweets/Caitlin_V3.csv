847622022087680000,Fri Mar 31 01:30:12 +0000 2017,Yay @SpaceX!! 😍
847539798613078000,Thu Mar 30 20:03:29 +0000 2017,YES! https://t.co/vR46n79UNN Too bad comments are broken 🤔
847210955180294100,Wed Mar 29 22:16:46 +0000 2017,Thanks all for the input on my last question! I’m re-fired up to film some different videos! ❤️ (and still a rebuild of the ITX build soon!)
847187078878244900,Wed Mar 29 20:41:54 +0000 2017,@Vir1lity yep. I’ll give it a go. It’ll be like running benchmarks on content. 🤔
847186667425468400,Wed Mar 29 20:40:16 +0000 2017,@FiFk4 😊
847184745272426500,Wed Mar 29 20:32:37 +0000 2017,@Vir1lity as someone who bedazzled her PC in a semi non-sparkly friendly environment, I think we both know the answer to this lol
847184368871362600,Wed Mar 29 20:31:08 +0000 2017,@Samwise8642 you are correct. We’ll see what comes of it.
847183494052761600,Wed Mar 29 20:27:39 +0000 2017,@FiFk4 a lot of channels get the same products and end up making similar videos. Rather pay for my own things and have original content.
847182884612001800,Wed Mar 29 20:25:14 +0000 2017,@FiFk4 true, but I’m not really worried about sponsors. As cool as free stuff is, it all just becomes like all the other channels on YT
847179480099643400,Wed Mar 29 20:11:42 +0000 2017,@Team316Stinger yeah, good point! Builds are expensive! I’m not at that point where I can bust new ones out nonstop like the big channels.
847179147025748000,Wed Mar 29 20:10:23 +0000 2017,@FiFk4 yeah I’m just worried about annoying current subs who see content in their feed they didn’t sign up for. But I’ll do a test and see
847174967439577100,Wed Mar 29 19:53:46 +0000 2017,@FiFk4 thanks for the input! I think I’ll do just this and see how it goes.
847173361897746400,Wed Mar 29 19:47:23 +0000 2017,@MaverickStar7 ☺
847173300350603300,Wed Mar 29 19:47:09 +0000 2017,@GenTsoChiken that’s probably the best idea. Do a test to see what happens.
847172615915622400,Wed Mar 29 19:44:25 +0000 2017,I feel like it should be a separate non-tech, more vlog-ish channel. And keep the tech talks, pc builds, component reviews on the current
847171912077922300,Wed Mar 29 19:41:38 +0000 2017,Should my YouTube stay just tech/pc builds? What if I want to talk about a recent book I read or anime or game.. same channel or separate? 🤔
847144750172045300,Wed Mar 29 17:53:42 +0000 2017,That S8 is pretty

846927622323945500,Wed Mar 29 03:30:54 +0000 2017,Think I got it figured out 👍
846848518421708800,Tue Mar 28 22:16:35 +0000 2017,@GenTsoChiken oh that’s way better! Guess that’s the route I’ll go. Thanks for the assist! 😁
846847599231619100,Tue Mar 28 22:12:55 +0000 2017,@GenTsoChiken oh I didn’t know they had flat rate international. I’ll look.
846847500057235500,Tue Mar 28 22:12:32 +0000 2017,@GenTsoChiken just basic 5lb small box, no speed selected, no extras
846845445389324300,Tue Mar 28 22:04:22 +0000 2017,@GenTsoChiken yeah.. I don’t understand how so many channels do it
846845139414896600,Tue Mar 28 22:03:09 +0000 2017,@ptthehawk lol I’ll keep that in mind
846845080153526300,Tue Mar 28 22:02:55 +0000 2017,@GenTsoChiken I randomly checked Poland and it was like $200+ to ship something video card size. 😳
846844286482206700,Tue Mar 28 21:59:46 +0000 2017,Is anyone familiar with how to handle worldwide shipping for a giveaway I want to put on my channel? Prices are crazy. 😬

841360875193737200,Mon Mar 13 18:50:39 +0000 2017,@SaucedTech I’m sure it does a tad but not debilitatingly. I’ll test temps at full load to be sure.

839579739710857200,Wed Mar 08 20:53:03 +0000 2017,What if every comment you made on the internet cost you $1? Perhaps more meaningful posts and less trolls. 🤔 @Twitter should test first.

818993932323258400,Wed Jan 11 01:32:24 +0000 2017,Amazing what you find on Steam. All released today nonetheless, lol. https://t.co/NczZLXPloG

818873350751547400,Tue Jan 10 17:33:15 +0000 2017,@GAMExSOLID have you seen reviews? They all seem to say it’s not worth it from the 6700k, or even 5th and 4th gen i7′s. Stay strong :)
818867713263054800,Tue Jan 10 17:10:51 +0000 2017,@GenTsoChiken ha, maybe. I miss it.

818524414186700800,Mon Jan 09 18:26:42 +0000 2017,@ptthehawk yeah, logistically I guess this is the reason. Shame. All these tempered glass panel cases to show a black (or bland) motherboard
818522670610321400,Mon Jan 09 18:19:46 +0000 2017,Why aren’t there more motherboards with designs on the PCB? 🤔 With full window side panels so common, I think this should be more of a thing
