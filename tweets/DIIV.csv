544371110259986400,Mon Dec 15 05:59:21 +0000 2014,I'm disgusted and deeply upset by the bullying I've experienced today. I tried my best to be open, honest, and available.
544369723463696400,Mon Dec 15 05:53:50 +0000 2014,I'm speaking publicly about it because I want to make it clear to everyone, more clear than anything, that I DO NOT CONDONE Devin's behavior
544368817326288900,Mon Dec 15 05:50:14 +0000 2014,But I don't believe in ANY way that it lessens the violence of his words. What he did is flatly WRONG. I will not tolerate bigotry anywhere.
544368209542250500,Mon Dec 15 05:47:49 +0000 2014,So I just want to be clear: I mention the context of Devin's words because so many of you spoke so loudly demanding that I do.
544367812362637300,Mon Dec 15 05:46:14 +0000 2014,But it seems by taking your criticisms of me to heart, examining the context of Devin's words, I've pointed the gun back at myself.
544366410030678000,Mon Dec 15 05:40:40 +0000 2014,But rather to draw ppl's attention to the culture of the site, and the violent language and ideologies its users have numbed themselves to.

544365128645640200,Mon Dec 15 05:35:35 +0000 2014,I maintained that the context of these words can't strip them of their violence. It seemed many people felt bigotry is OK if it's on 4chan.
