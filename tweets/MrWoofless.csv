801493786434084900,Wed Nov 23 18:33:04 +0000 2016,@xRpMx13 so getting a great resolution with with high colour count and decent refresh is good enough. I don't know much about tv screens doe
801493638979141600,Wed Nov 23 18:32:29 +0000 2016,@xRpMx13 if it's for console it doesn't really matter in terms of refresh rate imo. It's never going to be as smooth as if you had a pc.
