626098165134020600,Tue Jul 28 18:33:29 +0000 2015,@Gina_JerseyCity lol or I wasn't a good fit for it. Either way u look at it ... BROOOKLYNN!! good luck next year
626097917456187400,Tue Jul 28 18:32:30 +0000 2015,@RussJohnsonNBA getting back into a P/R offense and helping the team win in anyway. Also becoming a better player and realizing my potential
626095955167813600,Tue Jul 28 18:24:42 +0000 2015,@Gina_JerseyCity triangle cannot be ran by ONE player. PG doesn't hVe typical PG duties in triangle... Go "learn" the offense yourself  lol
626091280716689400,Tue Jul 28 18:06:08 +0000 2015,@Gina_JerseyCity Ran the triangle all yr and I played the most mins on team. Don't think your statement is valid ma'am. Have a nice day lol

625900132463190000,Tue Jul 28 05:26:34 +0000 2015,@prolificdotcom is Steve Nash the same player he was without a P/R.... NO. Who knows what kind of player he turns out to be.
625899774189928400,Tue Jul 28 05:25:09 +0000 2015,@prolificdotcom so therefor if you take a P/R player and stick him in an offense with minimum pick and roll, he won't be as successful
625899586838728700,Tue Jul 28 05:24:24 +0000 2015,@prolificdotcom I knew the offense. Different players have different skills sets that allow them to flourish correct?
