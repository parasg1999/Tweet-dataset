789271830456508400,Fri Oct 21 01:07:22 +0000 2016,Minna needs and inside presence and that starts with Fowles on both ends of the floor. Jia, Cruz and Howard need to chip in and help Maya
789271479082811400,Fri Oct 21 01:05:59 +0000 2016,Kristy and Essence both need to relax a Lil and bring their A game.  Nneka needs to play without fouling and Jantel needs to hit big shots.
789270927104016400,Fri Oct 21 01:03:47 +0000 2016,What adjustments would you make of you were LA or Minny?

789265772145029100,Fri Oct 21 00:43:18 +0000 2016,Nows the chance Minny needs to pull away with Nneka on the bench. Will the sparks regroup  or will Minny pounce?
789265419794133000,Fri Oct 21 00:41:54 +0000 2016,Big foul on Nneka.  That will hurt! Gotta have your MVP on the court. #Ouch

789263202450182100,Fri Oct 21 00:33:05 +0000 2016,@MooreMaya is the toughest player to defend hands down. She can score at will from anywhere on the floor. #truth
