822567256253235200,Fri Jan 20 22:11:31 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr brain to his fingers is a MAJOR concern to me. You are the PRESIDENT, and what you do and say affects millions.
822567064284106800,Fri Jan 20 22:10:45 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr his concerns seem to be more about himself &amp; rich people like vs the majority. And the fact that he has no filter from his
822566717691990000,Fri Jan 20 22:09:22 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr and hateful comments. Trump speaks &amp; does without any care to the consequence it will have on others. Only to benefit himself
822566558392352800,Fri Jan 20 22:08:44 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr Hillary's policies were way more in line with Bernie's, she had experience (some may argue too much), &amp; did not spew racist
822566232004161500,Fri Jan 20 22:07:26 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr yeah the DNC has some serious soul searching to do but when it came to Hillary or Trump the choice was clear to me.
822565921055187000,Fri Jan 20 22:06:12 +0000 2017,@scasey09 @Thomas_Marr this is true too. She has done a lot in support of women as well.
822565590216876000,Fri Jan 20 22:04:53 +0000 2017,@Jeffmonster same to you! it's been a pleasure and have a great weekend!
822565363082809300,Fri Jan 20 22:03:59 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr when it comes to Trump. Not to mention the tweeting...it's like an angry child having a temper tantrum
822564890502111200,Fri Jan 20 22:02:07 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr and is extremely easy to agitate and anger. Granted, you see those qualities in other politicians but it is to another degree
822564661732188200,Fri Jan 20 22:01:12 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr Trump is dangerous for the fact that he has no restraint, does &amp; says whatever it takes to win, has no concern for consequences
822564412305326100,Fri Jan 20 22:00:13 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr and I was a Bernie supporter originally. I do not think Hillary was a perfect candidate by any means but I do think...
822564150517829600,Fri Jan 20 21:59:10 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr oh sorry! True it didn't get coverage like Trump's. but also, Hillary didn't actually assault someone while Trump was accused
822563637898412000,Fri Jan 20 21:57:08 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr exactly. that's still wrong. whether it's kissing or actual rape, it's never ok without consent.
822563183172976600,Fri Jan 20 21:55:20 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr TBH I was in high school when he left office so I don't remember what the coverage was like but I remember hearing about it
822562866188390400,Fri Jan 20 21:54:04 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr is not OK that is truly disturbing. One of his statements was that the woman wasn't attractive enough to assault. Really?
822562446326042600,Fri Jan 20 21:52:24 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr Also, Trumps openly brags about it, about he can just take women whenever he wants. It's lack of awareness that that behavior
822562033845600300,Fri Jan 20 21:50:45 +0000 2017,@Thomas_Marr 1) I don't condone Bill's behavior nor support it 2) although there isn't evidence she shamed/intimidated them, if true NOT OK
822558569937719300,Fri Jan 20 21:37:00 +0000 2017,@Jeffmonster thank you! i think that in the end. a lot of us want many of the same things, including respect, love, &amp; a fair chance
