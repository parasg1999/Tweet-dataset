1227859530509193200,Thu Feb 13 07:38:19 +0000 2020,@samiul_e Probably some, not all of them because that would be an entire course on itself
1227859432945651700,Thu Feb 13 07:37:55 +0000 2020,@tcsddd Definitely continue the current one, this update is still a couple of months away. Don't limit your progress 😉

1227859094746300400,Thu Feb 13 07:36:35 +0000 2020,@thehumzahasan It will replace the current one, yeah
1227858983895040000,Thu Feb 13 07:36:08 +0000 2020,@Suleyman_Sahi In this case it's not about profitability, it's about making the course better for all students 😉

1220709148964335600,Fri Jan 24 14:05:15 +0000 2020,@niko3783 Depends only on what you want to achieve or build. PHP is for the back-end (I would suggest Node.js though), React for front-end
