1121147739075698700,Wed Apr 24 20:23:45 +0000 2019,8. It’s more important to get it right than it is to be right
1121147738056536000,Wed Apr 24 20:23:45 +0000 2019,7. Social media is not a connection tool, it’s a communication tool
1121147736856961000,Wed Apr 24 20:23:45 +0000 2019,6. Boundaries are the path to self-respect
1121147735632224300,Wed Apr 24 20:23:44 +0000 2019,5. During difficult conversations, don’t be afraid to say “time out, this isn’t feeling productive”
1121147734306766800,Wed Apr 24 20:23:44 +0000 2019,4. No one can be their best self when they feel powerless
1121147733228781600,Wed Apr 24 20:23:44 +0000 2019,3. If you think you’re paying too much with your soul and your life, you are
1121147732243173400,Wed Apr 24 20:23:43 +0000 2019,2. You cannot shame or belittle people into changing their behaviors
1121147731341381600,Wed Apr 24 20:23:43 +0000 2019,1. Vulnerability is the ability to lean in and show up when we feel uncertain, at risk, or emotionally exposed
